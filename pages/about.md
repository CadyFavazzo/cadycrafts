# Crafts Galore

Writing about making crafts is actually quite hard.

## About the Collection

I haven't prepared anything to say about crafts. 
It's complicated. 
Crafts and art are all wrapped up in class and gender.
If I were making this webiste for real, I'd write an essay about that.
Instead, here are the types of crafts in this collection.

- cards
- collage
- painting
- creatures
- clothing

And now here is a numbered list:

1. cards
2. collage
3. painting
4. creatures
5. clothing

This site is generated using [`collectionbuilder-gh`](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPEG images or PDF documents

The base site features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
